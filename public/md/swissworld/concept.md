# Swiss World Teamup #

## Preconditions ##

The world is adopting **remote working environments** with increasing speed, last but not least in the area of software
development.  
**Especially in software development** this will imply:

- Development teams in companies will more often and more easily **include individuals from diverse locations and
  nationalities**
- Salaries depend **less and less** on location, more and more on skills and know-how
- Offices are becoming **less important**
- Digital currencies might soon provide a **better financial infrastructure** for international commerce, much more
  independent of national restrictions

-------------

- This will provide **huge opportunities** for companies quickly and flexibly adapting to such obvious and disrupting
  changes
- **Switzerland is an ideal place**  for this to happen in the first place
    - It is a **multi-cultural** country with a long tradition to incorporate influences from a large number of
      countries
    - It already has a **well established financial infrastructure**, deeply connected to the rest of the world
    - It has a **good infrastructure and good living conditions for gifted people**
    - Its **regulatory system can adapt better** than that of larger countries to world-wide economical changes

## Concept ##

- **Swiss World Teamup** is offering services and consulting in software development for the FinTech area. Services will
  be offered as a modular system, open and flexible with respect to growth and extension.
- For every assignment,  **Swiss World Teamup**  will exclusively set up a *Remote Team* consisting of the best
  international experts fit to do the best job they can do.
- Every *remote team* will be managed locally **in Switzerland**. Single point of contact for the customer is their
  **swiss based project manager** who will always *"speak the language"* and will be accessable *"in person and for
  real"*.
- Except for management, **Swiss World Teamup** does minimize permant employments, instead working with independent
  and *"free"*
  experts from all over the world.

Thus **Swiss World Teamup** will offer IT services fit for the future, scaling up from small to large while keeping
costs much lower than any competitor.

## Unique Selling Proposition ##

Competitors often work with remote teams located in one or several countries. Teams consist of permanent employees and
are managed both remote and locally "*on premise*". The pain points are obvious, requiring all sorts of extra costs and
effort:

- Offshore company needed
- Offshore Management needed
- Offshore compliance needed
- Offshore employees needed, team is difficult to scale up or down
- Offshore offices needed

**Swiss World Teamup** will stay **borderless wherever possible**. It is **evident and inevitable** that future work
will
**no longer be tied** to locations or to nations.

We know that our idea do sound somehow utopian and far fetched. Nationalism is on the rise, all sorts of political and
regulatory restrictions are still in the way. The language barrier and cultural differences cannot be ignored.

But we believe that all these conditions are changing and improving in an ever increasing pace. We have just seen what
surprising changes in our working culture can be triggered by a pandemic nobody foresaw. Going to work will never be the
same after that! To us it is clear what path the current social developments are leading us on. We want to draw
consequences now ...
