- **Swiss World Teamup** is offering services and consulting in software development for the FinTech area.
  Services will be offered as a modular system, flexible and extensable.
- For every assignment, Swiss World Teamup will exclusively set up a Remote Team consisting of 
  the best international experts fit to do the best job they can do.
- Every Remote Team will be managed locally in Switzerland. Single point of contact for the 
  customer will always be a swiss based project manager. He “speaks the language”, is accessable“in person and for real” and he conforms to Swiss standards.
- Except for management, Swiss World Teamup does minimize permant employments, instead working with 
  independent and “free” experts from all over the world.

Thus Swiss World Teamup will offer IT services fit for the future, scaling up from small 
to large while keeping costs much lower than any competitor.

## Unique Selling Proposition ##

Competitors often work with remote teams located in one or several countries. 
Teams consist of permanent employees and are managed both remote and locally “on premise”.
The pain points are obvious and always imply all sorts of extra costs and effort:

- Offshore company needed
- Offshore Management needed
- Offshore compliance needed
- Offshore employees needed, team is difficult to scale up or down
- Offshore offices needed

**Swiss World Teamup** will stay **borderless wherever possible**. It is **evident and inevitable** that future 
  work will no longer be tied to locations or to nations.

We know that our ideas do sound somehow utopian and far fetched. Nationalism is on the rise,
all sorts of political and regulatory restrictions are still in the way. 
The language barrier and cultural differences cannot be ignored.

But we believe that all these conditions are changing and improving in an ever increasing pace. 
We have just seen that surprising changes in our working culture can be triggered by a pandemic nobody foresaw. 
Going to work will never be the same after that! To us it is clear what path the current social developments are 
leading us on. We want to react on that.
