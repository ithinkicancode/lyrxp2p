*This is Francine, she is trying pig farming, the pig is reared in bad conditions without a pig shelter.*

I’m 26 years old. In my family I face various problems including harassments and various abusive names.

When I was pregnant I was told hurtful words (they used abusive words). Friends and relatives hated me, and when I gave
birth they hated my child. They said that my child is like a worst thing which has come to their family.

It is a lot of
bad things that I have experienced. But now I have the idea of doing small scale farming activities (Animal farming and
Agriculture activities) for the purpose of finding how to feed my child and other essential needs like clothes, school
fees, health insurance, for making my child’s better life.

But we don’t have financial means for doing those activities.
So, if we can have a support of doing that we can improve our lives and our children’s well being.

Thank you.
