*Charlotte with her child, she is trying pig farming with local piglets but the piglets are reared in bad
conditions*

1.	I live in a bad life
2.	And my child
3.	To find food I have to work hard for others
4.	And my parents are harassing me
5.	In my family they are not happy for me
6.	Because I gave birth
7.	I don’t have to eat the day and the night
8.	I and my child always cry
9.	With much sadness
10.	So what can I do?
11.	Will I kill myself or? Please tell me if it was happening to you
12.	In my life I live miserably
13.	I gave birth at 16 years, and  now I’m 18 years old
